Unfortunately, images or detailed written sources are only scarcely available in many cases. Attempts to study historic individuals with genetic data so far focused on hypervariable regions of mitochondrial DNA and to some extent on complete mitochondrial genomes. To elucidate the potential of in-solution based genome-wide SNP capture methods - as now widely applied in population genetics - we extracted DNA from the 17th century remains of George Bähr, the architect of the Dresdner Frauenkirche. We were able to identify the remains to be of male origin, showing sufficient DNA damage, deriving from a single person and being thus likely authentic. Furthermore, we were able to show that George Bähr had light skin pigmentation and most likely brown eyes. His genomic DNA furthermore points to a Central European origin. We see this analysis as an example to demonstrate the prospects that new in-solution SNP capture methods can provide for historic cases of forensic interest, using methods well established in ancient DNA (aDNA) research and population genetics.","tags":["historic individuals","aDNA","ancient DNA"],"title":"Inferring genetic origins and phenotypic traits of George Bähr, the architect of the Dresden Frauenkirche","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Skoglund et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505944800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534966126,"objectID":"50b48d6d9728933eb4d3af36848b6c05","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/publication/07-african/","publishdate":"2017-09-21T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/07-african/","section":"publication","summary":"We assembled genome-wide data from 16 prehistoric Africans. We show that the anciently divergent lineage that comprises the primary ancestry of the southern African San had a wider distribution in the past, contributing ~2/3 of the ancestry of Malawi hunter-gatherers ~8100-2500 years ago, and ~1/3 of Tanzanian hunter-gatherers ~1400 years ago. We document how the spread of farmers from western Africa involved complete replacement of local hunter-gatherers in some regions, and we track the spread of herders by showing that the population of a ~3100 year-old pastoralist from Tanzania contributed ancestry to people from northeast to southern Africa, including a ~1200-year-old southern African pastoralist. The deepest diversifications of African lineages were complex, involving long-distance gene flow, or a lineage more deeply diverging than that of the San contributing more to some western Africans than others. We finally leverage ancient genomes to document episodes of natural selection in southern African populations.","tags":["African","aDNA","ancient DNA"],"title":"Reconstructing Prehistoric African Population Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lazaridis et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501624800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534966126,"objectID":"3f34e96bdaddaad3ab1814f305ed9335","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/publication/06-greeks/","publishdate":"2017-08-02T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/06-greeks/","section":"publication","summary":"The origins of the Bronze Age Minoan and Mycenaean cultures have puzzled archaeologists for more than a century. We have assembled genome-wide data from 19 ancient individuals, including Minoans from Crete, Mycenaeans from mainland Greece, and their eastern neighbours from southwestern Anatolia. Here we show that Minoans and Mycenaeans were genetically similar, having at least three-quarters of their ancestry from the first Neolithic farmers of western Anatolia and the Aegean, and most of the remainder from ancient populations related to those of the Caucasus and Iran. However, the Mycenaeans differed from Minoans in deriving additional ancestry from an ultimate source related to the hunter-gatherers of eastern Europe and Siberia, introduced via a proximal source related to the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia. Modern Greeks resemble the Mycenaeans, but with some additional dilution of the Early Neolithic ancestry. Our results support the idea of continuity but not isolation in the history of populations of the Aegean, before and after the time of its earliest civilizations.","tags":["Minoan","Greek","aDNA","ancient DNA"],"title":"Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Schuenemann \u0026 Peltzer et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496095200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534966126,"objectID":"e362359d65d6d84f8225324b5100a146","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/publication/05-mummies/","publishdate":"2017-05-30T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/05-mummies/","section":"publication","summary":"Egypt, located on the isthmus of Africa, is an ideal region to study historical population dynamics due to its geographic location and documented interactions with ancient civilizations in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Particularly, in the first millennium BCE Egypt endured foreign domination leading to growing numbers of foreigners living within its borders possibly contributing genetically to the local population. Here we mtDNA and nuclear DNA from mummified humans recovered from Middle Egypt that span around 1,300 years of ancient Egyptian history from the Third Intermediate to the Roman Period. Our analyses reveal that ancient Egyptians shared more Near Eastern ancestry than present-day Egyptians, who received additional Sub-Saharan admixture in more recent times. This analysis establishes ancient Egyptian mummies as a genetic source to study ancient human history and offers the perspective of deciphering Egypt’s past at a genome-wide level.","tags":["Egypt","evolution","aDNA","ancient DNA","Mummy"],"title":"Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arora et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480892400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534966126,"objectID":"f5df6189ae03282c7a45f69680c29117","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/publication/04-syphilis/","publishdate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/04-syphilis/","section":"publication","summary":"The abrupt onslaught of the syphilis pandemic that started in the late fifteenth century established this devastating infectious disease as one of the most feared in human history1.
