[{"authors":["Alexander Peltzer","Tobias Koch"],"categories":null,"content":" This document is based on experiences provided by Maxime Garcia at his blogpost on running CAW with AWSBatch and our own experiences. We just wanted to acknowledge the effort that Maxime also put into making this work!\nBasic Requirements In order to run this, you need to have a AWS account set up and create an IAM user for it. More detailed information on how to do this can be found under the above link. The IAM set up is described in the next section.\nIAM User setup Please follow the instructions on AWS to set up an IAM user for running Batch jobs on AWSBatch. This user has to be provided with the required permissions to run Batch jobs. Permissions on AWS are set up using the IAM service and you have to start by creating a new user using the \u0026ldquo;Add user\u0026rdquo; interface. Please attach the following permissions to your newly created user afterwards:\n AmazonEC2FullAccess AmazonS3FullAccess AWSBatchFullAccess  This should already suffice in terms of user permissions to run jobs on AWS Batch.\nService role setup Next, we need to set up permissions for AWS Batch to e.g. run/stop EC2 instances for us by generating the required roles on IAM. These are managed as separate roles in IAM under \u0026ldquo;Roles\u0026rdquo;. Some of these are created automatically for you when you set up a Batch job at the first time, but we can make sure that these are already present and configured properly beforehand.\nYou need the service roles:\n AWSBatchServiceRole ecsInstanceRole AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole  The latter two are not required if you are not intending to use spot instances (you should use them to save money!).\nAWSBatchServiceRole This role should have the policy AWSBatchServiceRole attached. ecsInstanceRole This role should have the policies AmazonS3FullAccess and AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role set.\nAWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet This role should have the policy AWSEC2SpotFleetServiceRolePolicy set.\nAmazonEC2SpotFleetRole This role should have the policies AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole and AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole set accordingly.\nOnce you have set these roles, the permissions for running a job with the selected IAM user can be used to configure a compute environment (CE) and a job queue to run your jobs.\nYou need to get the accesskey/token combination for using AWS and need to have these present on the machine starting the jobs in a file ~/.aws/credentials such as:\n[default] aws_access_key_id = KEY aws_secret_access_key = secretKEY  AMI Now that you have all the permissions set up you need to create a custom amazon machine image (AMI). This will be used later by the EC2 instances started by AWS batch.\nAMI preparation First you have to set up an EC2 instance which will later be converted into an AMI. Please use the ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux AMI since it provides docker installation and configuration.\nChoose a t2.micro instance for the instance type since the instance type does not impact the AMI.\nConfiguration of the Instance Details is not needed as the default configuration should suffice.\nDepending on the docker image sizes you expect your Batch instances to handle, choose a larger EBS storage in the storage configuration.\nOptional Tags can be added in Step 5.\nIn the last step configure your Security Group. Make sure you can connect to the EC2 instance when doing so. You can also let AWS create a security group for you.Now launch the instance.\nConnect to your t2.micro instance and perform the following steps:\n Update the yum repository sudo yum update Check the docker configuration and make sure the docker storage size matches your configured one. docker info Check whether awscli is installed aws --version Install awscli using miniconda  wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86\\_64.sh bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86\\_64.sh -p /home/ec2-user/miniconda /home/ec2-user/miniconda/bin/conda install -c conda-forge awscli /home/ec2-user/miniconda/bin/aws --version  AMI creation Now that you have configured your EC2 instance you can logout and stop the instance.\nIn the EC2 Management Console select the stopped instance and choose the Action Image-\u0026gt;Create Image\nChoose a name and a description and create the AMI.\nSet up QUEUE / Compute Environment In order to submit jobs to AWS Batch, you need to have a working compute environment (CE) and a JobQueue set up. Start with the CE and then create a compute environment.\nCompute Environment  Log in to AWS Batch Navigation menu: \u0026ldquo;Compute environments\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Create a new compute environment\u0026rdquo; Select \u0026ldquo;Managed\u0026rdquo; Provide a name for the Compute Environment Service role AWSBatchServiceRole Instance role ecsInstanceRole EC2 key pair: The key pair of the IAM user you intend to use for running AWS Batch jobs Select \u0026ldquo;on-demand\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;spot\u0026rdquo; (spot is cheaper) Select Maximum Price you\u0026rsquo;re willing to pay for spot instances Spot fleet role AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole Enable user-specified AMI id and provide the AMI id you created If desired, attach a Key/Value pair to make it possible to later generate e.g. billing information on a per compute environment basis  Select create and you\u0026rsquo;re all set!\nJobQueue set up  Log in to AWS Batch Select \u0026ldquo;Job queues\u0026rdquo; in Navigation menu Provide a name you remember (!) for your job queue Set a priority Select the previously created compute environment for running jobs  Select create and you\u0026rsquo;re all set!\nAWS Configuration Nextflow AWS Batch configuration in Nextflow requires a couple of things:\n Publicly accessible Docker containers per process or per pipeline Executor set to awsbatch JobQueue set to an enabled AWS Batch JobQueue An AWS region, e.g. 'us-east-1' AWSCli present in the AMI which runs the jobs S3 Buckets for temporary/work files and results  An example on how to deal with things is to ask your users to specify the missing parts on pipeline execution. A working example is set in ICGC-featureCounts where the awsbatch.config specifies the required parameters for execution on AWSBatch.\n workDir Executor Queue Region And a custom path to AWScli inside the customized AMI to schedule jobs  This is then set to default values in the nextflow.config of the pipeline and set according to user specified parameters when executing the pipeline. This way, users don\u0026rsquo;t need to change the awsbatch.config file but can instead rely on using a set of parameters --workDir, --awsqueue, --awsregion and should be fine.\nRunning a basic job with AWS Batch You can execute an AWSBatch job on your local workstation or on a running EC2 instance. For longer running jobs, it might make sense to use a small EC2 instance (t2.micro) to run your job, as you\u0026rsquo;re not relying on network connections between your local workstation and the AWS Batch CE/JobQueue then.\nYou can use nextflow cloud create \u0026lt;your-cloud-name\u0026gt; to launch a simple instance that has nextflow installed to create a simple instance for running AWS Batch jobs.\nFor this instance additional configuration can be provided in your nextflow.configor ~/.nextflow/configfile.\ncloud { imageId = 'ami-xxxx' instanceType = 't2.micro' keyName = \u0026lt;AWS keyname\u0026gt; userName = 'ec2-user' }  Troubleshooting I don\u0026rsquo;t want to risk requesting instances when nothing runs anymore - what should I do? Simply disable the JobQueue and the Compute Environment and nothing will be requested when there are no jobs running. In our experience, failing jobs will also result in instance termination.\nI have configured nextflow according to your suggestion but every job fails with Essential container in task exited - how can I fix that? Open CloudWatch and look at the log for the failed task. If the error is aws command not found or bash: /home/ec2-user/miniconda/bin/aws: No such file or directory\u0026rsquo; then make sure aws is installed and there are no typos in your nextflow.config.\nI found an AMI option for the nextflow.config file but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work - is it broken? No, the cloud.ami configuration is only used for cluster creation. AWS Batch is a different service and the AMI needs to be specified inside the compute environment.\nThere is no --workDir option. Where can I find it? The --workDir, --awsqueue ,--awsregion options are provided by the pipeline. If your pipeline is no nf-core pipeline those options won\u0026rsquo;t be present. You would have to specify queue and region in your nextflow.config file. You can also provide the work directory with the nextflow parameter -work-dir / -w.\n","date":1534802400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534970248,"objectID":"82b44e37b1fb23d5cf121c1e9b82fc20","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/post/01-aws-nfcore/","publishdate":"2018-08-21T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/01-aws-nfcore/","section":"post","summary":"How to run AWSBatch with NF-Core pipelines using Nextflow.","tags":["Bioinformatics","NF-Core","Nextflow","AWS","Cloud Computing"],"title":"Running nf-co.re pipelines with AWSBatch","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Slides can be found here.\n","date":1530828000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534968855,"objectID":"c730dd0319378715525b6c04bb13774b","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/talk/14-ismb/","publishdate":"2018-07-06T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/14-ismb/","section":"talk","summary":"Slides can be found here.","tags":["reproducible research","Bioinformatics","Nextflow","Nf-core"],"title":"NF-Core: Community-based best practice pipeline development in Nextflow","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Slides can be found here.\n","date":1530136800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534968855,"objectID":"3770a82ae36184ce07c19f5f27a695cd","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/talk/13-isc2018/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/13-isc2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Slides can be found here.","tags":["reproducible research","Bioinformatics","Nextflow","Nf-core"],"title":"Reproducible data analysis with Nextflow \u0026 NF-Core","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Peltzer et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517439600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534966126,"objectID":"e53d3eadef87df8723f5a069fda17e84","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/publication/08-baehr/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/08-baehr/","section":"publication","summary":"For historic individuals, the outward appearance and other phenotypic characteristics remain often non-resolved. Unfortunately, images or detailed written sources are only scarcely available in many cases. Attempts to study historic individuals with genetic data so far focused on hypervariable regions of mitochondrial DNA and to some extent on complete mitochondrial genomes. To elucidate the potential of in-solution based genome-wide SNP capture methods - as now widely applied in population genetics - we extracted DNA from the 17th century remains of George Bähr, the architect of the Dresdner Frauenkirche. We were able to identify the remains to be of male origin, showing sufficient DNA damage, deriving from a single person and being thus likely authentic. Furthermore, we were able to show that George Bähr had light skin pigmentation and most likely brown eyes. His genomic DNA furthermore points to a Central European origin. We see this analysis as an example to demonstrate the prospects that new in-solution SNP capture methods can provide for historic cases of forensic interest, using methods well established in ancient DNA (aDNA) research and population genetics.","tags":["historic individuals","aDNA","ancient DNA"],"title":"Inferring genetic origins and phenotypic traits of George Bähr, the architect of the Dresden Frauenkirche","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Skoglund et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505944800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534966126,"objectID":"50b48d6d9728933eb4d3af36848b6c05","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/publication/07-african/","publishdate":"2017-09-21T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/07-african/","section":"publication","summary":"We assembled genome-wide data from 16 prehistoric Africans.

We document how the spread of farmers from western Africa involved complete replacement of local hunter-gatherers in some regions, and we track the spread of herders by showing that the population of a ~3100 year-old pastoralist from Tanzania contributed ancestry to people from northeast to southern Africa, including a ~1200-year-old southern African pastoralist. The deepest diversifications of African lineages were complex, involving long-distance gene flow, or a lineage more deeply diverging than that of the San contributing more to some western Africans than others. We finally leverage ancient genomes to document episodes of natural selection in southern African populations.","tags":["African","aDNA","ancient DNA"],"title":"Reconstructing Prehistoric African Population Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505685600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534968855,"objectID":"84e2c62021658ffd068060f7accb00bb","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/talk/12-gcb2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-18T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/12-gcb2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["ancient DNA","Bioinformatics"],"title":"Modern computational methods in ancient DNA analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504389600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534968855,"objectID":"e065399705099ebe3277550f33f743f9","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/talk/11-mge/","publishdate":"2017-09-03T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/11-mge/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["ancient DNA","mitoBench","mitoDB"],"title":"MitoBench and MitoDB: Novel interactive methods for population genetics on mitochondrial DNA","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Lazaridis et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501624800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534966126,"objectID":"3f34e96bdaddaad3ab1814f305ed9335","permalink":"https://apeltzer.github.io/publication/06-greeks/","publishdate":"2017-08-02T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/06-greeks/","section":"publication","summary":"The origins of the Bronze Age Minoan and Mycenaean cultures have puzzled archaeologists for more than a century.

However, the Mycenaeans differed from Minoans in deriving additional ancestry from an ultimate source related to the hunter-gatherers of eastern Europe and Siberia, introduced via a proximal source related to the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia. Modern Greeks resemble the Mycenaeans, but with some additional dilution of the Early Neolithic ancestry.
